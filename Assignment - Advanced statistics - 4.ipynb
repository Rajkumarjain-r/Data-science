    "The critical region for the test is split between the two tails of the sampling distribution, and it allows you to detect differences in both directions.\n",

    "Suppose a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug to reduce blood pressure. The null hypothesis (H0) states that the drug has no effect on blood pressure. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) states that the drug reduces blood pressure significantly. During the study, the drug is administered to a group of patients, and based on the data, the researchers reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug is effective in reducing blood pressure.

    "The probability of committing a Type 2 error is denoted by the symbol β (beta) and is dependent on the power of the statistical test. Power (1-β) represents the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it is false.\n",

    "Example Scenario (Type 2 Error):\n",
    "Continuing with the previous drug example, suppose the new drug does indeed reduce blood pressure significantly in the population. However, due to a small sample size or other limitations in the study, the researchers fail to detect this significant effect in their analysis. As a result, they fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug has no effect on blood pressure, which is a Type 2 error.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, there is always a trade-off between Type 1 and Type 2 errors.
